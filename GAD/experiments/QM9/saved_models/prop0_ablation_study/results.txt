This ablation study considered the following hyperparameter choices and trained on a random subset of QM9:
hid_dims = [50, 50, 25]
n_layers = [6, 3, 6]

The results were the following:

-> Full model:
    --- Final MAEs---
    Train MAE: 0.6304
    Val MAE:   0.5708
    Test MAE:  0.8069


-> Model with only 3 layers:
    --- Final MAEs---
    Train MAE: 0.4446
    Val MAE:   0.5989
    Test MAE:  0.7514


-> Model with only size 25 embedding:
    --- Final MAEs---
    Train MAE: 0.6395
    Val MAE:   0.6318
    Test MAE:  0.8421


Due to time constraints, the results were obtained in only one random subset of QM9 and therefore might not be completely
representative. However, it is interesting to note that decreasing the number of layers did not undermine the performance
of the model, which suggests that 3 layers might be enough to ensure communication between the atoms whose relation
determines the first property of the QM9 dataset.

Meanwhile, decreasing the embedding size is clearly detrimental.
