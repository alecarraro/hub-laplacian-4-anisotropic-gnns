# Hub Laplacian Operators for Directional GNNs

This is the GitHub repository for our CS4350 project, "Hub Laplacian Operators for Directional GNNs."

## ðŸ“„ Full Report

The complete project report, `Report_GNN_project.pdf`, can be found [here](Report_GNN_project.pdf).

## ðŸš€ Running the Models

This repository contains implementations of two models: our custom Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) and a modified version of Graph Attention Diffusion (GAD).

### 1. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)

To run the implemented GCNN:

1. Navigate to the `GCNN/` directory.
2. Open `main.py` and modify the script to choose your desired hyperparameters.
3. Execute the script.

### 2. Modified Graph Attention Diffusion (GAD)

To run the modified GAD model:

1. Go to `GAD/experiments/QM9/`.
2. Refer to the `README.md` file within this directory for detailed instructions and ready-to-use sample commands.
